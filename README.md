##Getting Started:
- Clone Project to your disk and delete '.git' folder
- Fulfill the prerequisites ([Documentation](#prerequisite))
- In project folder, trigger npm install ([How to use npm](#npm))
- Create a new repository ([Git?](#git))
- Enter your Name as author in package.json and give the project a name
- Build your application with the default grunt task ([Grunt](#grunt))

##Documentation
__Prerequisite:__<a name="prerequisite"></a>

- NodeJS must be installed (https://nodejs.org)
- Git must be installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Text Editor (of choice), recommended: [Atom (open source)](https://atom.io/) / Visual Studio

__Npm:__<a name="npm"></a>

- Open a terminal window (Mac: Terminal, Windows: Command Line (CMD))
- Navigate to where you downloaded the Project folder to
    - use the command `cd` to switch folders relative to your current position (hit enter to confirm)
        - go outside of current folder with `cd ..`
    - use the command `ls` on mac (`dir`on windows) to show all files/folders that are in the current folder
    - TIP: go to the folder you want in the Finder on mac (Explorer on windows) and copy the path, then past it behind `cd ` in terminal to move there
- now type npm install and hit enter

To learn more about NPM visit [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm).

__Git:__<a name="git"></a>

All you need to do here is:
- in the Terminal/Command Line (in the project folder, as with npm) type `git init`
- Now you neet to go to an online GIT Server (github or your own) and create a new repository there
    - copy the link to the repo
- Either use the command line:
    - Stage all files: `git add .`
    - Link with online repo: `git remote add origin ` and paste the online repo link (e.g.`git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git`)
    - Commit the files: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
    - Finally, type `git push -u origin master` (you will get ask for your credentials to TTA Git. Enter them..)
- Or use [SourceTree (free GIT client)](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to link the GIT repo on your disk with the online repo, and then post the initial commit
    - You should ignore the 'dist' folder and the 'node_modules' folder, as they get automatically generated by the GRUNT process. It is not necessary to keep track of them via GIT

__Grunt__<a name="grunt"></a>

- in the Terminal/Command Line window (in the project folder, as with npm) type `grunt`
- if the terminal reports that the command is not found, type `npm install -g grunt` and then repeat the first line
- in your projects folder will appear a `dist` folder, in there are the finished files
- upload your finished files to ICEC
